# ðŸ§  CNN Denoiser Training Notebook

This repository contains a Python Jupyter Notebook for building and training a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed to perform **denoising** on path-traced images. The trained model is later exported to **ONNX format** for integration into Unity via **Barracuda**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- Implements a custom CNN architecture for image denoising
- Trained on a **synthetic dataset** generated from Blender scenes
- Designed to work with **low-sample path-traced images**
- Outputs a model compatible with Unity (ONNX format)
